### **"What is PIK Token?"**

{% hint style="info" %}
We are preparing for the ecosystem that the advancement of blockchain technology will bring. We anticipate that the upcoming tokenization, i.e., the blockchain ecosystem based on global currency units, will play a crucial role in expanding business opportunities. We are confident that by adopting a service based on global currency units in the legitimate business wager game market, we can expand worldwide. To realize this vision, we have obtained legal casino licenses in Kenya and Uganda. With these licenses as a foundation, we aim to lead the blockchain-based wager game market. Through the introduction of the PIK token, we aspire to create a new blockchain-based casino ecosystem.

### **"PIK Token is deployed on Ethereum network."**

{% hint style="info" %}
To increase accessibility for users Pik Token is deployed on Ethereum network. Along with blockchain technologies on N-PIK sites we also integrated hybrid decentralized services based on Ethereum through patented “s2k L2 system”. This enables users to transparently prove Ethereum deployed assets (game utility tokens, N-PIK token etc.) on a daily basis.

### **"PIK ICO"**

{% hint style="info" %}
The issuance of PIK Tokens is limited to 100% of the total ICO supply, ensuring that token supply is realized exclusively through ICO. Additionally, in the phased sale via ICO, should the company's revenue surpass a certain threshold (to be disclosed later) following the N-PIK service launch, PIK Tokens will no longer be available for sale. Any tokens that remain unsold will be either burned or distributed through airdrops exclusively.)

The reason for burning the entire unsold portion when the company revenue exceeds a certain threshold is to reduce the period and costs of recovering 5% of the circulated coins during the stable phase of the service (conducted with revenue for marketing). This is done to maximize the profit impact for early ICO participants.

The future disclosed threshold will be based on revenue generation and profitability, setting a point where the service can safely grow. Business strategies to expedite this point will be developed. All licenses acquisition and service content development have already been completed, and the substantial realization of PIK ICO and PIK Token's profits will be accelerated by the significant marketing impact of our blockchain-based service.

To maximize effectiveness and expedite the quick return of investment and profit realization for N-PIK ICO participants, we plan to airdrop PLYP.

The funds raised will be used to launch N-PIK services and cover marketing, development, and update costs.

### **"What is Play PIK Token (PLYP)"**

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an event token that will be airdropped to those who participated in the N-PIK ICO.

\-   Playing with PLYP\
You can play with the token. The ICO payout price is $0.08, and when used in the game, they will be available at a rate of $0.1 per 1 PLYP.

\-   Trading with other users\
You can trade PLYP within the N-PIK site or through affiliated exchanges.\
Early ICO participants have an advantage in recovering their ICO participation fee by selling PLYP. Buyers can buy and participate in the game at a lower cost, which is about 20% more favorable than the actual token value.\
Example) If you play the game with USDT, you will spend 10 USDT; if you play the game with PLYP, you can buy PLYP worth 10 USDT for 8 USDT through person-to-person transactions and proceed to the game. In other words, PLYP holders have an advantage in closing the transaction if they sell at a lower price than the normal market price.

\-   Bankswap via N-PIK.\
The swap function between PLYP and USDT will use 30% of N-PIK revenue to recover at a rate of $0.105 per 1 PLYP.\
Example) You can buy PLYP at the initial issue price of $0.8, enter the game at a value of $0.1, and exit at $0.105 via Bankswap. If you buy PLYP at $0.8 and then immediately bank swap, you will have a 31.25% return without playing the game.\
With 30% of N-PIK's daily profit going to Bankswap, users looking for a quick exit strategy can take advantage of this feature.\
Services like these allow ICO participants to get their money back quickly.\
\* Bankswap will continue until all PLYP issued from the initial ICO participation have been redeemed.

\-   N-PIK Token + PLYP Collection Stability Up.\
The reason we are introducing PLYP is to provide ICO participants with the opportunity to retrieve their ICO participation funds through transactions and gameplay using PLYP while maintaining the assets of PIK Token.\
\* PLYP can only be initially airdropped through ICO participation, and the PLYP airdrop service may be terminated early regardless of the ICO's continuation.\
\* The lineup of games using PLYP coin is limited to the in-house provided lineup.
