## 1. Service Background

\
In the Blockchain financial market, we have already experienced 2 bull markets.

The first bull market has happened when the market boomed due to expectations of a new Blockchain financial era, led by Bitcoin.

The second bull market led to a market boom based on various technologies, systems, and related systems utilizing Blockchain.

It can be said that the Blockchain financial market so far has been formed by market expectations and the market size that has flowed in due to those expectations.

In other words, it can be said that an ecosystem was formed through the rise and fall of coin prices through expectations, the emergence of users who realized profits through this, and the influx of users who admired them.

It cannot be viewed as a market formed by proving its value through actual sales and performance through market services.

The Blockchain financial market will clearly serve as an important market axis in the process of the 4th industrial revolution.

To achieve this, it is time for the Blockchain financial market to prove its value through business performance, that is, sales through the market.

There is a belief that the real winner in the Blockchain market is an exchange.

This is because exchanges provide trading services in the market and generate substantial market sales.

In this way, the coin that will fundamentally lead in the 3rd bull market will be the coin that can prove its value through sales of content.

We chose the Blockchain casino business as the service that will shape the market.

Like an exchange, actual service sales can be formed immediately, and through this, the actual value of the coin can be proven and grown for dividends and burning services.

In addition, by taking advantage of Blockchain’s unique value as a global currency, we can lead the newly formed global casino market using Blockchain with scalability that can be accessed by anyone around the world.

We will work with you to create great growth opportunities in the upcoming 3rd bull market.\


## 2. Market Opportunity

The Blockchain casino market is forming a market with Rollbit at the forefront starting in 2023.

Rollbit Coin (RLB) faced 13,000% growth in the first six months of 2023, and the example of Rollbit online casino's annual revenue reached around $355 million as of 2023 sets a good precedent.

As various latecomers such as Ethereum, Solana, and BNB have proven their achievements against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s growth, 2024 will be a year in which the Blockchain casino market can enjoy opportunities for challenge and growth.

These market factors will serve as marketing elements and proving opportunities for N-PIK services.

Rollbit Coin (RLB)'s growth in 2023 may be difficult to face exponential growth in value even if it grows in 2024.

Even if Bitcoin goes to $80,000 through the third bull market, you can only see a 2x growth rate of return.

In terms of returns, new altcoins with the backdrop of the third bull market may generate higher returns.

However, choosing a new altcoin also carries risks.

This brings with it the problem of whether it is possible to prove the actual value of a new coin through its market business.

One of the easiest ways to solve this problem would be dividends and burn.

In other words, if this is quickly proven through dividends and burning through actual business performance, even if the first dividend and burning costs are small, the value of the coin will be formed and traded assuming the value of the upward trend period (sales increase period) of business sales.

The opportunity to acquire a coin like this at the lowest price will make our challenge meaningful.

The service that best demonstrates this can be seen as Rollbit in the Blockchain casino market.

N-PIK, which started with the success of the market as a background, will provide the value of new profit realization to new users as well as existing users who have experienced this market.
