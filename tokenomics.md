## <mark style="color:orange;">**1. PIK**</mark>

### 1) PIK Token Supply Plan

* 1st Seed Sale: 25,000,000
* 2nd Presale: 35,000,000
* Institutional: 30,000,000
* Airdrop: 50,000,000
*   Marketing and Ecosystem: 10,000,000

> <mark style="color:yellow;">In the N-PIK coin ecosystem, there are no company-held shares or developer coins related to the company whatsoever. This implies that the company has no resources to influence the market, such as arbitrarily leading the coin price or generating additional profits and increasing circulation by selling holdings during coin value rises, leading to a price drop.</mark>

### 2) Coin Ecosystem Goal

> <mark style="color:yellow;">The total supply of this coin is not issued with the aim of achieving full circulation. Instead, it is intended to maintain a minimum circulation regardless of the total supply, with the remainder being burned, depending on market conditions.</mark>
>
> <mark style="color:yellow;">\*Our ecosystem goal: to maintain minimal circulation for service and actively reduce coin circulation through a burning policy for service.</mark>

The N-PIK platform token “PIK” will be distributed exclusively through various airdrops and ICOs. The service has introduced a token ecosystem to align with the blockchain casino trend, aiming for marketing efficiency, user acquisition, and expansion. The objective is to generate market value based on the N-PIK service's performance. To this end, the N-PIK service plans not to distribute the entire ICO issuance at once but rather based on the achievement of specific marketing goals. This approach includes a focus on achieving a rapid burn rate through various systems, with the expectation that the nature of the N-PIK Token as a dividend token will lead to an increase in its value. The airdrop service will provide game continuity for users, contributing to the N-PIK service's success.

In addition, unsold tokens from each sale phase will be handled according to the needs of the ecosystem at the time, including burning, airdrop allocation, marketing purposes, and company reserves. This strategy aims to quickly respond to market needs and maintain the flexibility of the platform by reflecting updates to the ecosystem graph or relevant sections as needed.

The stage where local casino taxes are charged.



* PIK dividends are paid in USDT and distributed according to the Ex Staking criteria.&#x20;
* Unsold or undistributed tokens may be partially or fully burned depending on ecosystem conditions.
* There are no holdings by the company or developers, only distributions related to ICOs, airdrops, and marketing. There are no foundation-related distributions beyond the designated distribution.
* The revenue share of PIK will remain consistent at 30-50% (during events) for the first year after launch. There is a possibility that this percentage will be adjusted by a certain percentage after the first year. If such adjustments are implemented, the goal will be to fine-tune the ecosystem ratio, promote game airdrops, ensure service stability, and maintain ecosystem balance.
