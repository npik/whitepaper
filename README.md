N-PIK is an online betting service operated by "Sonic Crypto Gaming Uganda Limited" as its Ugandan entity, having obtained a legal casino license from the Ugandan government and implementing blockchain technology. This service was invested in license acquisition and development for over a year, and it is currently preparing for a service launch in January 2024.

Cryptocurrencies based on blockchain play the role of a global currency that can be easily acquired and used anywhere in the world, providing universal accessibility unaffected by the user's location. We have chosen the online casino market as a sector where the fastest profitability can be achieved in the blockchain based global currency market. This market, even by the standards of other successful companies, is worth $5 billion in betting alone, and it is expected to expand further in 2024. We aim to lead this anticipated market with our unique transparency and stability.
