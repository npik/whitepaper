> N-PIK is an online betting service operated by a local entity SONIC CRYPTO GAMING (U) LIMITED in Uganda, which has obtained a legitimate casino license and implemented blockchain technology. The service has been investing in licensing acquisition and development for over a year, aiming for a release in March 2024.



> Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies serve as a universal currency, providing accessibility worldwide regardless of the user's location. We have identified the online casino sector as the most profitable field within the blockchain-based global currency market. This market, valued at $5 billion in betting alone, is projected to expand further in 2024. With our commitment to transparency and stability, we aim to lead this anticipated market.
